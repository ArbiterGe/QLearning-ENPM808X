# Qlearning-ENPM808X Final Project

## Overview

Autonomous robots are the next big thing influencing the tech industry. With tech majors such as google, amazon and apple investing heavily on autonomous tech it is certain that such robots a going to majorly impact our life in the near future. 

When a robot is in an unexplored environment, it does not know the set of best actions to perform for that environment in order to navigate autonomously without colliding. In this software we are taking the example of a turtlebot navigating a maze. While the Turtlebot is in the operating environment, it is nearly impossible to define all possible states, and actions for those states, prior to navigating the full environment. Even if such a case is possible, it may not generalize well for a new environment. Under these circumstances, training the agent with a sequence of rewards for the random actions that it performs, is much easier. This is where Q learning comes into play. The agent is positively rewarded when it performs a desirable actions (not colliding with obstacles), given a state. Similarly, it is negatively rewarded when it performs an undesirable action (like colliding with an obstacle). While using rewards as a learning input, it is easy to define a numerical evaluation function over all states and actions, and base the optimal policy on this evaluation function.
