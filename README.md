# Qlearning-ENPM808X Final Project

## Overview

Autonomous robots are the next big thing influencing the tech industry. With tech majors such as google, amazon and apple investing heavily on autonomous tech it is certain that such robots a going to majorly impact our life in the near future. 

When a robot is in an unexplored environment, it does not know the set of best actions to perform for that environment in order to navigate autonomously without colliding. In this software we are taking the example of a turtlebot navigating a maze. While the Turtlebot is in the operating environment, it is nearly impossible to define all possible states, and actions for those states, prior to navigating the full environment. Even if such a case is possible, it may not generalize well for a new environment. Under these circumstances, training the agent with a sequence of rewards for the random actions that it performs, is much easier. This is where Q learning comes into play. The agent is positively rewarded when it performs a desirable actions (not colliding with obstacles), given a state. Similarly, it is negatively rewarded when it performs an undesirable action (like colliding with an obstacle). While using rewards as a learning input, it is easy to define a numerical evaluation function over all states and actions, and base the optimal policy on this evaluation function.

This project will implement a Qlerning algorithm for training a turtlebot to navigate inside a maze (created on gazebo) by avoiding obstacles. The project will show working of the algorithm by using a demo that shows the turtlebot navigating inside the maze without colliding.

## Run
Follow the following steps to build the package
```
cd mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src
cd ~/catkin_ws/
catkin_make
source devel/setup.bash
cd src
git clone https://github.com/senthilarul/QLearning-ENPM808X.git
cd ..
catkin_make
```

## Test
To run test

cd ~/catkin_ws/
catkin_make run_tests
rosrun qlearning qlearntest.launch
```
## Running Demo
To run the demo
```
cd ~/catkin_ws/
source devel/setup.bash
rosrun qlearning qlearn.launch
```
Please follow the video for running the demo and installation of package.

## Record Rosbag
```

rosbag play roombatopics.bag
```
## Dependencies
ROS Kinetic
Gazebo 7.9
turtlebot_gazebo package
RViz
Catkin

And created using C++ on a Ubuntu 16.04 LTS machine.

More information to be added soon.

## Known Issues/bugs
As evident from the demo program, the maze requires the turtlebot to take only left turns. The sensor on board the turtlebot has a range of about 60 degrees. This software divides the laserscan range into 4 and uses it as the state for the Q-learning algorithm. Since the sensors visibility is towards the front the algorithm does not train well when trained in environments with both left and right turns. 
This is not a deficiency in the algorithm but in the sensor. 
A modification to a sensor with a higher angular range such as Hokuyo would solve the isse.

Sometimes the path entry for qtable during the testing doesnt work. Please fill in the full path in the pragram (qlearning class->loadQtable function instead of path)
